# Entity Framework Core (EF Core) Roadmap for 2025

## Step-by-Step EF Core Roadmap

### 1. Fundamentals and Setup

- Understand EF Core and ORM concepts.
- Learn how to set up EF Core in .NET projects, install NuGet packages, and configure database providers (SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- Learn about `DbContext`, `DbSet`, entity models, and basic configuration practices (connection strings, dependency injection).

### 2. Data Modeling and Relationships

- Master Code First approach and database migrations (`Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`).
- Define entity relationships: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.
- Learn Fluent API for advanced configuration and constraint mapping.
- Explore property mapping, shadow properties, value conversions, and unique constraints.

### 3. CRUD and LINQ Queries

- Implement CRUD operations using `DbContext`.
- Practice LINQ-based querying (`Select`, `Where`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy`, `Include` for eager loading).
- Learn filtering, paging, sorting, projections, and advanced LINQ techniques.

### 4. Loading Strategies and Performance

- Understand lazy, eager, and explicit loading.
- Use tracking (`ChangeTracker`), `AsNoTracking`, and leverage split queries for optimization.
- Learn batch operations, aggregation, and performance tuning tips.

### 5. Advanced Features and Patterns

- Learn transaction handling (`BeginTransaction`), isolation levels, and concurrency management.
- Explore modeling strategies: Table-per-hierarchy (TPH), owned entities, keyless entities, value objects.
- Study using multiple databases in one application.
- Implement Repository and Unit of Work
